      - added new command `\OpfGuide`, for adding items to `<guide>`

        Usage:

             \OpfGuide[filename]{title}{reference type}

         `filename` is optional, current file name is used when empty. See
         [epub 
         secrets](http://epubsecrets.com/where-do-you-start-an-epub-and-what-is-the-guide-section-of-the-opf-file.php)

         engines. This will hopefully improve also Epub3 readers.

it](https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht#instalation) 
         in order to use current `tex4ebook` version.
